# Quiver Ammo Plugin

## Overview
The Quiver Ammo Plugin for RuneLite is a simple yet essential tool for Old School RuneScape (OSRS) players who want to keep track of the ammo present in their quiver. Whether you're using arrows, bolts, or any other type of ammunition, this plugin ensures that you always know how much ammo you have left, helping you avoid running out during crucial moments in combat.

## Features

2. Go to the Plugin Hub by clicking on the wrench icon in the top-right corner.
3. Search for "Quiver Ammo" in the Plugin Hub.
4. Click "Install" to add the plugin to your RuneLite client.
